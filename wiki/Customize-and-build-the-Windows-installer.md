# Customize and Build the Windows Installer

## Translations
Most of the translations for the installer are taken directly from the installer generator Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

You can add translations for CopyQ-specific messages in `shared/copyq.iss`. Just copy lines starting with `en.` from `[Custom Messages]` section and change prefix to `de.` (for german translation).

## Modify and Test Installation
Normally the installation file is generated automatically by Appveyor which executes [appveyor-after-build.bat](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ/blob/master/utils/appveyor-after-build.bat) to generate portable app folder from build files and runs Inno Setup (the last line).

So you basically don't have to build the app, you just need:
- the unzipped portable version of the app,
- clone of this repository and
- [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

Open [shared/copyq.iss](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ/blob/master/shared/copyq.iss) in Inno Setup and add few lines at the beginning of the file.

```
#define AppVersion 2.8.1-beta
#define Source C:\path\to\CopyQ-repository-clone
#define Destination C:\path\to\CopyQ-portable
```

You should now be able to modify the file in Inno Setup and run it easily.
