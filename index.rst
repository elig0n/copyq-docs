Welcome to CopyQ's documentation!
=================================

CopyQ is clipboard manager -- a desktop application which stores content of the
system clipboard whenever it changes and allows to search the history and copy
it back to the system clipboard or paste it directly to other applications.

This documentation describes some basic concepts and workflows as well as more
